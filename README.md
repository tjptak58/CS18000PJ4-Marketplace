Handout
The third option is to implement the official marketplace of the application. The marketplace will allow sellers to list their products and customers to purchase them. 

Looking for an example? Review the listing pages for any online store. 


Reminder: You can assume that only one user is accessing the application at a time. A seller might log in, list a product, then log out. A customer could then log in and purchase the item. 

Your implementation must have the following: 
Core
Market
The marketplace will be a centralized page listing available products for purchase. 
Products will include the following information: 
Name of the product
The store selling the product. 
A description of the product
The quantity available for purchase
The price
The marketplace listing page will show the store, product name, and price of the available goods. Customers can select a specific product to be taken to that product's page, which will include a description and the quantity available. 
When items are purchased, the quantity available for all users decreases by the amount being purchased. 
Sellers
Sellers can create, edit, or delete products associated with their stores. 
Sellers can view a list of their sales by store, including customer information and revenues from the sale. 
Customers
Customers can view the overall marketplace listing products for sale, search for specific products using terms that match the name, store, or description, and sort the marketplace on price or quantity available. 
Customers can purchase items from the product page and review a history of their previously purchased items. 
Selections
Files
All file imports must occur as a prompt to enter the file path.  
Sellers can import or export products for their stores using a csv file. 
All product details should be included, with one row per product. 
Customers can export a file with their purchase history.  
Statistics
Sellers can view a dashboard that lists statistics for each of their stores.
Data will include a list of customers with the number of items that they have purchased and a list of products with the number of sales. 
Sellers can choose to sort the dashboard.
Customers can view a dashboard with store and seller information.
Data will include a list of stores by number of products sold and a list of stores by the products purchased by that particular customer. 
Customers can choose to sort the dashboard.
Shopping cart
Customers can add products from different stores to a shopping cart to purchase all at once, and can remove any product if they choose to do so. The shopping cart is preserved between sessions, so a customer may choose to sign out and return to make the purchase later.  
Sellers can view the number of products currently in customer shopping carts, along with the store and details associated with the products. 
Optional Features: 
Sellers can elect to hold sales that reduce the price of a product until a specified number of units are sold. Customers will be informed of the original and sale price when browsing the marketplace. 
Customers can leave reviews associated with specific products from sellers. Other customers can view the reviews after they post. Sellers may view reviews on their products. 
Sellers may set a per product order quantity limit that prohibits customers from ordering more units than the limit. Customers will not be able to place any additional orders for a product after they reach the limit, unless the seller increases or removes it.
